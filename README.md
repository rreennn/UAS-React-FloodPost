# Disclaimer

This project was made for my Client Side Programming subject exam
The web still has many room for improvement!
THIS WEB ISN'T RESPONSIVE YET!! DON'T OPEN WITH PHONE!!

In this project, I aim to make complete crud and auth process with ReactJS. For the full experience of that process, I use MongoDB as database and made my own API

The idea of Flood Post is where you can inform about flood happening or user's past experience of flood and share it with other users (kind of like twitter thing, but ofc not that good :P)

If you read this, thanks! Feel free to use the project!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
